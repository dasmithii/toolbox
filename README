Overview

    Toolbox provides utilities to aid the development of C-based
    software projects. It includes excessively reimplemented
    functions and data structures, plus a few convenience macros,
    which deal mostly with error handling.

Installation/Usage

    The easiest way is simple copy/paste. Clone this repository
    into a subdirectory within your project and alter your
    Makefile (or Makefile analog) accordingly.

    If you don't need the toolbox unit tests, or any particular
    tools, feel free to exclude them from your source tree. Most
    people, myself included, include the sources subdirectory 
    alone.



Testing

    There are some fairly thorough unit tests in the /tests 
    subdirectory. To perform these tests, enter said directory, 
    run 'make', and execute the build output with: './test'. 
    In the case that a test fails, submit an issue on GitHub 
    and I'll deal with it ASAP.
